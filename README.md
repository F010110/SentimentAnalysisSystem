# SentimentAnalysisSystem

This is a small-scale project for sentiment analysis on Twitter texts.
Among the baseline models, SVM stands out with a 96.2% accuracy rate.
Closely following, Random Forest achieves 95.9% accuracy.
Boosting algorithms and KNN also perform well, reaching around 90% accuracy.

However, GRU model didn't reach my expectation. After hours of tuning, the accuracy is still fluctuating around 96%.

Then I'm going to try the BERT.
