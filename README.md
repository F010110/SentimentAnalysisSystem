This is a small-scale project for sentiment analysis on Twitter texts.
Among the baseline models, SVM stands out with a 96.2% accuracy rate.
Closely following, Random Forest achieves 95.9% accuracy.
Boosting algorithms and KNN also perform well, reaching around 90% accuracy.

However, to my disappointment, GRU model trails at only 92.9% accuracy.I'm trying to enhance it.
Now It has improved to 95.5%. Still lower then SVM.

Other models are still on the way.
